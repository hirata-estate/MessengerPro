### For anyone who just went down the fork chain to find a release:
**This probably won't work.**
At the very least, this doesn't even install on Android 16.
This was forked on 2025-08-13, I have no fucking clue how any of this works either.
You can find an APK file of the Xposed module in the Actions tab, which will install but may not work on A14.
